# AIM:
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of a Student Enrollment Management System.
# SRS (Procedure):
1.The Student Registration System is designed to automate the process of registering students in an educational institution.

2.It helps manage student details, course information, and enrollment records efficiently.

3.The system allows students to register, choose courses, and update personal information easily.

4.Administrators can view, modify, and manage student and course data through the system.

5.UML diagrams like Use Case, Class, and Activity diagrams are used to design system flow and interactions.

6.The system reduces manual work, saves time, and ensures accurate data management.

7.Overall, it provides a faster, more secure, and organized way to handle student registrations.
